# Math-calculator
Hi!!!!
This is just a python project i'm practicing with that also helps me in school.
Currently it can fully plot triangles based of sides and angles
you need to install: numpy, matplotlib, and tkinter
I have it using 3.9.16 but it will probably work on other python versions

But have fun if there is something you can contribute to my knowledge please tell me, Thanks!!!
