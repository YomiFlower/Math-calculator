# Math-calculator
Hi!!!!
This is just a python project i'm practicing with that also helps me in school.

Currently it can fully plot triangles based of sides and angles.

you need to install: numpy, matplotlib, and tkinter.

I have it using 3.9.16 but it will probably work on other python versions.

But have fun if there is something you can contribute to my knowledge please tell me, Thanks!!!
